Inventory of AI Use Cases (guidance)

The Advancing American AI Act, Executive Order (EO) 14110, and OMB Memorandum M-24-10, require Federal agencies to report on their use of AI.
Agencies must:

• conduct an annual inventory of their AI use cases
• submit metrics on AI use cases not subject to being individually inventoried, and
• provide information about determinations and waivers

The OMB drafted a guidance that provides the criteria, format, and mechanisms for Federal agencies to complete the required reporting activities for the 2024 calendar year.

Use cases
An AI use case refers to any application of AI designed, developed, acquired, or used specifically to advance the execution of agencies' missions and their delivery of programs and services, enhance decision making, or provide the public with a particular benefit.

Included AI Use Cases
- Agencies must inventory planned, new, and existing AI use cases

Agencies must consider:
- whether they are implemented using standalone AI capabilities or AI that is embedded within other systems or applications,
- whether the AI was developed by the agency,
- whether it was developed or procured by third parties on behalf of agencies for the fulfilment of specific agency missions, or
- whether the agency procured the AI.

Excluded AI Use Cases
- Uses of an AI application to perform a standalone task a single time
- AI use cases that are implemented using commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products that are unmodified for government use and are used to carry out routine productivity tasks, such as word processors and map navigation systems.
- AI for Research and Development (R&D)
- AI used as a component of a National Security System or within the Intelligence Community.
