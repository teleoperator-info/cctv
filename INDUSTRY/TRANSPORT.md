Does AI Enhance Your Security in the World of Transport?



> The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional systems like CCTV has signalled a new era of capabilities and potential. A decade ago, AI in video surveillance was in its infancy, surrounded by scepticism due to its oversold and misunderstood capabilities. Fast forward to today, and the growth in AI’s capabilities has outpaced our understanding. The shift from a product-centric to a customer-centric approach in selling AI solutions has expanded the horizons of AI and video surveillance partnerships, transcending beyond just security.

> Two significant advancements in AI have been Object Identification and Behavioural Analysis. Object Identification allows the system to focus on specific elements in a scene, such as differentiating between vehicles or recognising faces and texts. Behavioural Analysis, on the other hand, interprets actions and emotions, discerning between a person jogging or fleeing, or detecting signs of distress or aggression.

> The combination of cameras and AI as data-capturing tools opens limitless possibilities. Beyond security, these technologies find applications in health and safety, marketing, HR, and system management. For instance, in public transport, AI can analyse passenger flow and behaviours to optimise advertising placements, detect potential fraud, or identify safety concerns, thereby enhancing both operational efficiency and user experience.

> ### Uses in Transport
>
> Practical applications in transport are manifold. AI systems can monitor passenger numbers to avoid overcrowding, analyse seating preferences for strategic advertising, and ensure compliance with regulations like matching bus passes to passengers. These systems also play a crucial role in safeguarding drivers against false accusations and monitoring their well-being.

> [Stortech’s Driver Monitoring System (DMS)](https://www.stortech.co.uk/cctv-products/systems/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) is positioned on the vehicle’s dashboard, overseeing the driver to deter distractions. Audible alerts are emitted for activities such as mobile phone usage, smoking, lack of seatbelt or mask, and signs of drowsiness. This not only enhances driver safety but also offers crucial video evidence that can vindicate the driver in the event of an accident, safeguarding both passengers and road users.

> ### Data Security
>
> The concern around data security in AI systems cannot be overstated. According to IBM Global AI Adoption Index, 60% of enterprises globally are not developing ethical AI policies, with 52% not safeguarding data privacy through the entire lifecycle. It’s imperative for custodians of data to respect, protect, and not misuse the information. Public trust is foundational, and adherence to regulations like GDPR and the Data Security Act is crucial for the sustainable and ethical use of AI in surveillance.

> Since the introduction of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies using CCTV on their premises are now required to take certain measures to ensure that footage of employees and the general public is stored and used appropriately. This includes only keeping footage for as long as it is needed, after which it should be deleted, and clearly informing people on-site that security cameras are in operation. People also have the right to request footage of themselves, if they wish to see it.
>
> When storing footage, many companies will anonymise people’s faces, to ensure that the data being stored contains an appropriate amount of information for its intended purpose.
>
> The private operator of the King’s Cross development recently came under fire for deploying facial recognition technology in its surveillance network without express content, and without notifying the public. It sparked a public outcry and an investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which led to the programme being scrapped.
>
> AI in transport security is not just about enhancing safety; it’s about reimagining the potential of surveillance systems, and it’s crucial to balance innovation with ethical considerations.
